Markov is a Russian mathematician that discovered the famous Markov model - we’ll avoid the maths for simplicity sake. 
The model says : The future is independent of the past given the present. Where we end up is determined by where we are at now and
not where we’ve been.

It struck me that the model has more than a mathematical utility. 
As a consequence of this model’s assumption we can hold solace in the fact that no matter what we’ve been through or 
how far we’ve gone wrong, we can - and should change course to determine our future. Our past is not a determinant of where we can go. 
We can and should continually reinvent ourselves.

One might ask shouldn’t we learn from our past? Should we just forget all that has happened? 
One way to answer that is our present is a culmination of our past - where we are currently is as a result of our past decisions.
The past is data, if we learn from data, we improve our future decision. But we must not hold on to the past. People spend too
much time dwelling there, and it seems to not be a good predictor of the future. While useful, we must ensure to be in the 
present.

Another argument for the past is its utility in gratitude. It’s thanksgiving season, one of the most asked questions is 
what are you grateful for? One can draw from positive moments of the past that makes us hope for the future. Because it was good 
in the past, it can be better in the future. We can cultivate gratitude from the past that makes the present/future more meaningful 
and livable. If we choose to remember past moments, let it be stories and memories that displays hope despite today’s challenges.

Markov leaves us with an empowering statement, you can always change course - once you decide to at different stages of your life whether young or old.
Above all, be present, for that’s what most important to your future.
