This is an update from my previous article Learning Bioinformatics in 2023[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-bioinformatics-2023-step-by-step-guide-tobi-aminu/?trackingId=bw2S8rhEQ7ulbnKLtorkXA%3D%3D]

Everything still stands, learning the foundation cannot be replaced. 
As an enthusiast I am interested in how the learning is changing as technology advances, It is also a good way to document for myself the evolution of bioinformatics learning.

I started working in a different aspect of biology, infectious disease and I'm suprised the amount
of opportunities available for computational work. but the solutions are far fetching, not ubuiquitious as the problems.

## How can we leverage technological advancement to enhance computational biology learning?


### Use AI/Chat bot to enhance learning.
Few years ago, i will have to spend hours on google and stackoverflow to solve my coding problems. Now theres chatgpt, github copilot, large language models are everywhere, It makes no sense to spend hours on basic mundane task, this frees up space for creative work.

You have to use it, adapt with it, change style

Word of caution, this models make mistakes and perform poorly on creative or novel work. There are good for brainstorming and initial idead generations.

### Use a workflow manager
When I started out, I remember writing the same command individually and saving my output.
Then after a few months i try to remember what code I ran, sometimes I'm lucky enough to have written it down, other times no. I had to run the command again, sometimes the result could change.

workflow managers like snakemake, nextflow help in reproducibility and automation.
Now i have a history of the codes i ran, I also don't have to run individual commands any more.

### Project Organization and document code
Workflow management relates directly project organization.
A good project organization, is the one you can refer to in 10, 20 years time.
It is a foundational practice that we "computational people" ignore and I'll always take the oppourtunity to resound it again.

### worry less about what computer I use
Back in the day, I spent to much time than I should have about what laptop to get for my work.
Now i just connect to a high performance computing cluster. With the amount of compute power available and cloud computing advancement. The Computer I use is one less problem.
Even storage, the compute power and storage available on the cloud is enormous.

I'm still learning and I'm still documenting.
