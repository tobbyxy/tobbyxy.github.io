True Understanding
Looking for the crux or meat of what you're trying to achieve. Zooming in and out constantly and not letting your short term goals distract your long term vision. Most of the experts I've seen always have an idea of what they want to achieve.
Problem solving is easier when you understand. True understanding is not easy. I always catch my self looking for true understanding, merely memorizing definitions, reciting terms is not true understanding. 
when do you truly achieve understanding? I don't know, Here is what I think; 
when you can rederive a concept from multiple starting point (I heard this from somewhere). When you are not bound by definitions and maybe when you have alternative explanations (maybe even contradicting).

Understanding takes time and patience. so you sleep with the problems and wake up with new or sometimes clearer definitions and ideas.
True understanding requires understanding a system so you take the most optimal path to solving the presented problems.
