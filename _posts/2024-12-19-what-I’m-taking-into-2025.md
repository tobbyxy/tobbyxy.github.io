Prioritizing physical and mental health
Healthy eating and better sleep schedule
Making time for hobbies , friendship and relationships
Working long hours doesnâ€™t mean productive
Become a domain knowledge expert, Getting better at my craft
Good communication, writing, networking.
The best bioinformaticians are the ones who know how to frame the right question to ask, they always have a deeper domain knowledge

I tell myself around biologist, Iâ€™m a statistician and around statisticians, Iâ€™m a biologist.

Getting familiar with AI tools
The best innovation weâ€™ve seen in the past decade came from computers (software), the future is no different. Almost every now and then try to use some new AI tool. Everyone knows ChatGPT, have you tried cursor or perplexity?

Cursor for coding, Perplexity for search

Most of your big breaks are just a network away from you.
Networking/Mentors work, if you see someone you admire who has gone the path you wish to go, reach out and form the connection.
The smartest people I know are humble, they share their time and ideas freely.
If you can provide value and youâ€™re not well compensated consider changing your environment. An umbrella is not useful until thereâ€™s a rainfall.
Service. Consider doing for others what youâ€™ll like to be done for yourself. In putting others first, you help yourself.


Wishing you a happy holiday.

See you soon!
